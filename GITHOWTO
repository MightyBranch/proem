*Creating a feature branch*

    When starting work on a new feature, branch off from the develop branch.

        $ git checkout -b myfeature develop

*Incorporating a finished feature on develop*

    Finished features may be merged into the develop branch definitely add them to the upcoming release:

        $ git checkout develop
        $ git merge --no-ff myfeature
        $ git branch -d myfeature
        $ git push origin develop
