## DESCRIPTION

A lightweight, simple MVC for PHP5.4

The main objective here is to create a lightweight, simple & fast MVC implementation using PHP5.4

## INSTALLATION

Installation is simple. Place the root Proem directory wherever you like and insure that the
lib directory is on php's include_path. That's it !

## CONTRIBUTING
We have made available a PHP5.4 sandbox for users wishing to contibute to the project. Becuase PHP5.4 is still in release cadidate stages and is as yet not marked stable and probably wont be popular for a little while to come yet, any users wishing to contribute might not be able to get there hands on a PHP5.4 install.

If you are serious about helping out but don't have access to PHP5.4 please get in contact. I can set you up shell access to our sandbox and you can start contributing today.

You can request access by making a ticket on the issue tracker and tagging it with the infrastrucure tag.

#### Feeds & IRC
Proem now has a dedicated twitter feed http://twitter.com/proem which will automatically post any commits as well as news. If you plan on helping out, you should follow this.

Also available now is an irc channel (#proem) on freenode. Join if you have any questions.
